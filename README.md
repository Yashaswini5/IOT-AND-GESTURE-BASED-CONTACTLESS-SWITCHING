# IOT-AND-GESTURE-BASED-CONTACTLESS-SWITCHING
To avoid the risk of contracting Covid-19, it is important not to touch surfaces including switches, doorknobs, and keys that have been frequently used by other people. The goal of this project is for a contactless switch that works with hand gestures, mobile application and manually in case of need.
